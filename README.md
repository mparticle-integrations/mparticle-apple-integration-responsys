## Responsys Kit Integration

This repository contains the [Responsys](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/) integration for the [mParticle Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk).

### Adding the integration

1. The Responsys Kit is available via Cocoapods. And Responsys SDK requires manual integration with the application.

2. For adding the Responsys SDK, refer to  the [Step-by-Step guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFA/ios/step-by-step/) and follow steps [1] through [7].

	**NOTE**: In **step [2]**, download your app's **pushio_config.json** file, however, this does not need to be added to your app, you will need its contents to create the Responsys Connection in your mParticle workspace. 

3. Add the kit dependency to your app's Podfile or Cartfile:

    ```
    pod 'mParticle-Responsys', '~> 1.2'
    ```

    OR

    ```
    github 'mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-responsys' ~> 1.2.3
    ```

4. Follow the mParticle iOS SDK [quick-start](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk), then rebuild and launch your app, and verify that you see `"Included kits: { Responsys }"` in your Xcode console 

> (This requires your mParticle log level to be at least Debug)

5. Reference mParticle's integration docs below to enable the integration.

6. To enable additional features of the Responsys SDK like In-App Messaging, Notification Preferences etc., follow the respective guides available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCFB/ios/).
